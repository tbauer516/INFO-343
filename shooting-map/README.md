# Map Challenge: Police Shootings

This folder contains your submission for the [map challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/map). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What information does your visualization show? What 'argument' are you making? #####
> The argument I am making is that there is a large difference in the number of women and men who are involved in police shootings as victims. There is also a breakdown by race as well as percentages of the victims killed to look at how many of the victims were actually killed, which could be filtered by race.

##### 2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I did not complete any advanced extensions.

##### 3. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> I did take one suggestion from Joshua Hall from the Slack discussion board.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> It took me at least 10-12 hours to complete this challenge.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> The only recommendation I have for future students would be to teach them how to interact and parse JSON files in an easy manner. Though it was not a challenge for me, others I aided in their project struggled with that aspect.
